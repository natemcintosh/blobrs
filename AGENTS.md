## Instructions
Instructions, in order of importance, from most to least.

1. Always ask any questions you have before starting work.
1. Use `tmux` to interact with and test the TUI rendering.
1. For anything beyond the simplest of tasks, create a todo list, check it and update it as you go.
1. When working in rust, think carefully about what assumptions are being made, and think about how to encode them with the rust type system.
1. Check your work often with the compiler (e.g. cargo for rust, go for go, etc.)
